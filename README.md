# Image to TTS Converter

This application was designed to take images of text and convert them to a Text To Speech (TTS) audiobook.
I made this because I cannot be bothered to actually do the readings for my university classes.

It works by reading the images in a folder that are labelled from 1 onwards (eg: 1.png, 2.png. 3.png...) and create a TTS mp3 file in the same directory

There is a more comprehensive walkthrough in the files

Download the ready to go zip file from [HERE](https://github.com/MxFox555/Images_To_TTS/releases/download/Release/Release.zip). Compiled with PyInstaller.

## What it needs
Everything it needs is inside. It uses the Tesseract OCR letter recognition application and the python ttsx3 module

## OS Support
It is built and tested in Windows. It may work in Linux by using the Wine application and idk about Mac OS bc I cannot test it.
